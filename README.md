# Pavement Disease Classificator

The **Pavement-Disease-Classificator** is an advanced image classification project designed to identify and categorize various pavement diseases, including potholes, cracks, and surface degradation. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, this project aims to enhance the inspection and maintenance processes of road infrastructure, providing accurate diagnostics to aid engineers and road maintenance authorities.

## Models Used

This project implements the following machine learning models for classification:

1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:
   - A supervised learning model that classifies data by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
   - A simple, yet effective classification algorithm that assigns a class to a sample based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.

3. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**:
   - A deep learning model specifically designed for image classification tasks. It leverages convolutional layers to automatically extract features from images, improving classification accuracy.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - The project begins with collecting a dataset of pavement images representing various diseases.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Images are preprocessed to enhance quality and ensure uniformity, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Each model is trained on the processed dataset, utilizing a portion of the data for validation to monitor performance.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall metrics to determine the most effective approach for pavement disease classification.

5. **Real-time Classification**:
   - The best-performing model can classify new images in real-time, providing quick diagnostics for road maintenance.
